### Greetings!

I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Neuroscience.
Currently, I am working towards a career in data science and bioinformatics.
Since the summer of '22, I have been self-learning the fundamentals of R & Python.
Any advice, recommendations, or mentoring is welcomed!
I can be reached via email (alanwk@umich.edu) at any time.
