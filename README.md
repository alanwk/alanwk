### Greetings!

I am currently a Bioinformatics master's student with a bachelor's in Neuroscience. My experience includes work on hyperparameter optimization for a cell segmentation CNN and development of a multi-model neural network used to segment the optic nerve in CT scans. I am pursuing a career in medical computer vision with hopes of applying machine learning methods to the healthcare environment.
